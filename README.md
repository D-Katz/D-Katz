### Hey there! I'm David 😎

### I'm in my second year studying Computer Science at Carleton Univeristy in Ottawa, Ontario.

My most recent position was being a Teaching Assistant at Carleotn, where I helped teach a first-year Discrete Structures class.

I'm most comfortable in Java and Python, and have many years of experience writing code in both. Furthermore, I've explored many different languages and frameworks including React.JS and SQL.
