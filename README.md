### Hey there! I'm David 😎

### I'm in my second year studying Computer Science at Carleton Univeristy in Ottawa, Ontario.

My most recent position was being a Business Intelligence Developer at CFIA, where I used many DBA and Back-End Tools to improve Data flow between Clients/Warehouse, as well as optimized report creation which helped Dev/Client communication.

I'm most comfortable in Java, C++, and Python Furthermore, I've explored many different languages and frameworks including React.JS, Docker, and SQL.
